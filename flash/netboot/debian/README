This folder contains the debian live distribution that is booted on target to allow flashing an image downloaded from network.

This custom image must be as small as possible and contains the minimum tools.

To customize the boot filesystem, in chroot, just run:
- make edit
then exit chroot: the squashfs filesystem is rebuilt automatically.

Otherwise, go into rootfs, adjust files and run:
- make squashfs

NB: a better way is to rebuild the debian live and to use the procedure in src/ subdir. Drawback: the procedure only works on a debian host.
