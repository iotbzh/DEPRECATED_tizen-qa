This procedure needs a recent Debian host with the package live-build already installed.

References: http://live.debian.net/
Guide: http://live.debian.net/manual/current/html/live-manual.en.html

To rebuild the debian live suited to flasher needs:
- make clean
- make config-minimal
- make build
- cp binary/live/filesystem.squashfs ..
- cp binary/live/vmlinuz ..
- cp binary/live/initrd ..

The specific scripts used by the QA flasher are located in qascripts and copied into rootfs at build time.
