You can go back to the directory screen by following the top link.

The browse/edit part of the screen is divided in two blocs:

- the navigation bloc allow you to switch from one test case to the other,
to add a test case, to store or paste a test case.
- the edition bloc shows the data of the selected test case and allow you
to modify it.

The position of the 2 blocs depends on the size of your navigation window.

== Storing and pasting

This facility is intended for either have templates or 
copy test cases inside or across QAMETA files.

Clicking on store will store the current test case data in 
a regiter named following the test case naming (caution: 
minor bug currently there is no visual feedback but dont 
worry about it, it works even if nothing is visible).

Clicking on *paste* opens the paste menu:

image:paste.png["pasting data",width=1024]

Here you can

- Cancel the pasting
- Clear all the registers
- Paste one of the register of stored data to the current test-case. 
It replaces all the previous values with the one of the test case stored.

The registers are stored for long time: you must clear all to 
make your navigator forget it.

use a clone of a git repository and that manages
himself the *git push* to the central repository.
