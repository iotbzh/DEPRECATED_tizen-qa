== Scope of this Document 

This test plan defines test scope, test strategy and test execution for {componentName} within Tizen PC.

== Glossary 

// Instructions:
// Describe all important acronyms or terms here
// Example:
// * BBC: Brake Before Clutch (driver training)
// * CNN: Chaotic Neural Network
// ...

GNOME:: GNU Network Object Model Environment: Building a full, user-friendly desktop 
	 for Unix operating systems, based entirely on free software.

== Component Summary 

// Instructions:
// Expect a short paragraph to describe the component and add link for further information about this component.
// Also put major hyperlinks to projects responsible for the component

GNOME is a rich platform environment for building user friendly applications.
GNOME is a desktop environment.
GNOME platform can be divided in 3 parts: the CORE, the DESKTOP and the
APPLICATIONS, as defined below.

CORE::
    All components less or more hidden that are used by any applications.
DESKTOP::
    The components that are usual from the user scope and that distinguish
    GNOME from other desktops environements. This are specifics desktop intrinsic
    applications. For example: the settings, the accessibility manager,
    the login in screen, ...
APPLICATIONS::
    The applications use the GNOME platform, specifically the CORE components.
    The GNOME applications usually may run on other desktop environments, like
    Enlightnement  -- for example -- , if core components that they depends on
    are availables.

The CORE of GNOME is made of several parts as shown on the figure below:

.Figure: The CORE items of the GNOME platform
image:gnome/gnome-overview.png["Overview of GNOME platform",width=800]

These components are low level but important, because they are at the basis of all the
GNOME applications that the users use. A short description of these components
is made <<appendix-A,appendix A>>. They are at the heart core of the GNOME platform.

Generally, from a user point of vue, GNOME is the DESKTOP environment. 
For TIZEN, the GNOME DESKTOP is extended with a component named ``Tizen Shell''.
The Tizen Shell will be tested apart. Anyway, Tizen Shell is on top of the GNOME
desktop tools. Here we will test the good working of the functionnalities the
GNOME desktop utilities.


GNOME is also a rich set of APPLICATIONS. 
Some of them are available in the TIZEN PC distributions.
These applications are important in the user exeprience of all days.
It is what the user see and use.
So it have to work.
Then it have to be tested.

The  <<appendix-B,appendix B>> shows the full list of the containing packages 
that make GNOME under TIZEN.

== Features to be Tested 

// Instructions
// List all of the features of this component.
// Assign a test priority to each feature and provide reasons. 
// This requires some risk analysis. Here Priority considerations are user impact and likelihood of defect.
// 
// Priority table:
//
//             \           Likelyhood
//              \  
//   User Impact \| High | Medium | Low        |
//  -------------------------------------------|
// | High         | P1   | P2     | P2         |
// | Medium       | P2   | P3     | P3         |
// | Low          | P2   | P3     | Not tested |
//  ------------------------------------------- 
//
// Risk analysis examples:
// * P2: Likelihood of defect in this library is low as it is from upstream and stable enough after many releases. Current version 3.2 is also utilized in Fedora. But it is a key package of all user experience(UX) applications. So user impact is High if it has a defect.
// * P1: Likelihood of defect in this library is high as it is a newly developed component from scratch. Moreover, it is a key package of all UX applications. So user impact is also High if it has a defect.

What will be checked are the main available functionnalities, proving
the correct integration of the application.

// If necessary, explain why these items are not to be addressed in this test plan.
// Identify WHY the item is not to be tested. This could include such reasons as:
// * Not to be included in this release of the Software.
// * Low risk: has been used before and is considered stable.
// * Will be released but not tested or documented as a functional part of the release of the software.
// * Third-party features or components that will not be tested by our team.
// * Software features will be tested by other teams.

|===================================================================================================================

NOTE: Gnome Terminal will not be tested itself but will be used to to launch some tests.

== Test Strategy and Approach 

// Instructions:
// HOW TO TEST THE COMPONENT)
// Specify refinements to the approach described in the project/product test plan.
// Include specific test techniques (such as test methodology, test framework, automation, test type, and test level) to be used.

Gnome functionalities are tested exhaustively 
by the developers/testers of GNOME’s community. 
See more details here: http://www.gnome.org/get-involved/.

In case some bugs are identified in Gnome and block or fail 
our tests, they will be reported (if not existing yet) in 
Gnome’s bug tracker https://bugzilla.gnome.org/.

Most of the low level components aren't to be tested directly. 
In place of that direct testing, we suggest to use the indirect angle of attack.
The high level applications and desktop utilities are intensively using the 
core components of low level. 
So any defect in an application or a desktop utility is linked either to
a low level component (that is the indirect approach) or to the tested component
itself.
Then testing the high level component will be a good coverage test for the usecases of
the low level components. That is the indirect approach.

The following components are tested indirectly:

| Component							  | Comment
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| folks								  | Tested indirectly through Empathy and settings
| gnome-online-accounts			  | Tested indirectly through Empathy and settings
| gnome-keyring					  | Tested indirectly through seahorse
| gnome-menus						  | Tested indirectly in an other test plan ({qa-tp-homescreen})
| gvfs								  | Tested indirectly through Nautilus
|===================================================================================================================


IMPORTANT: As written above, only the integration has to be tested.
The main concern is the mainstream usability of the tested applications.
We expect that the developpers of the applications made full coverage 
detailled tests before having  the applications integrated in Tizen. 
So there is no use to test each parameter, each window, each little detail
of them.

NOTE: [red]#TODO# Add links to existing Gnome Test Plans, if any (none referenced yet)

=== Test Levels

// Instructions:
// Describe the test level (unit test, API level test, integration test, system test, and so on) for different sub-components.
// Test level will reflect the test priority of features.
// Test the high priority items extensively, medium priority items broadly, and the low-priority cursory.
//
// In general, unit test and integration testing are not covered in QA's test plan.
// If certain areas or aspects of the system imply high risks for the product, more thorough testing is obviously a solution.
// Focus testing effort on portions of the software where risk of potential failure is greatest or where potential failure would be most catastrophic.

For each component or application, here below called component, one or more
of the tests listed below are performed.

At least, for all component the following test are performed:
- Acceptance Test
- Sanity Test
- Main features Test

==== Acceptance Test

// Instructions:
// Acceptance test set is fully automated. It can be run under Common Automated Test System (CATS) or Testkit to check distribution quickly after it's generated by release engineer.
// Acceptance test usually covers image installation, boot up, basic kernel and driver, core services, Power and Performance (PnP) and stability check points, which helps the release engineer to make a quick decision on if the current image is qualified for further integration and QA activities.

Installation of the component using zypper works: the component and its dependencies are installed.

==== Sanity Test

// Instructions:
// Sanity test is a very brief run-through of the entire distribution, to ensure the basic health of the distribution and to report major regressions at the earliest time. All the checkpoints in a sanity test reflect the most important functionality, stability and PnP of the distribution.

The component can be run: none of its runtime dependency is broken, 
it can start in the Tizen environment without crashing.

==== Main features Test

// Instructions:
// Feature test is designed to test product requirements or features. It includes both functional and non-functional (such as performance and stress) tests, as well as negative tests. 
// Feature Test covers both Feature Verification Test (FVT) and Extended Feature Test (EFT).

The main feature(s) of the component works: the component doesn't crash, it 
performs the expected behaviour in the expected time, it stops itself properly.

//==== Feature Verification Test

// Instructions:
// FVT, the most key test for a feature, is designed to verify product features (in JIRA).
// FVT is conducted on a weekly basis when a feature is implemented and integrated to distribution.
// FVT should be reviewed by developers.
// Feature status update:
//    * A feature is marked Verified/Closed if its FVT passes.
//    * A feature is reopened if its FVT fails. In this case, related major bugs should be linked to the feature.

//==== Extended Feature Test

// Instructions:
// EFT is designed to verify delivery of features forming full functionality of an entire component. 
// After the component is fully integrated, all componen-related test cases will be executed for selected release.
// In addition, all the bugs against the component and its features will be reported. 
// The EFT set will be run again in the upcoming milestone or when significant changes are applied to the component and its features.

//==== DataFlow Test

// Instructions:
// Dataflow is the flow of data to, from and within a device. 
// Inputs are derived from system use cases. Each core dataflow test case presents the basic instance of the use case in core stack.
// The result of core dataflow test could report the maturity level of Core OS software and hardware integration on a specific device.

//==== System Test (E2E Test)

// Instructions:
// System Test is targeting to evaluate delivered functionalities from a system perspective. 
// It tests how the entire system is working and interacting with consumers (end users) instead of user interface (UI) or application.
// Its test cases cover the most critical interaction and negative scenarios that consumers may encounter in their daily usage.
// Therefore, a system test is usually designed to cover product use cases.

==== PnP Test

// Instructions:
// PnP test set includes all system power and performance test cases, to get memory footprint, CPU consumption, response data, FPS, and smoothness with specific workload.

The component power consumption, its CPU usage and its time to perform defiend task
are measured and compared to an expected target.

//==== Stability Test

// Instructions:
// Stability test is designed to determine the robustness of software by testing beyond the limits of normal operation.
// Stability test commonly put greater emphasis on robustness, availability, and error handling under a heavy load, than on what would be considered correct behaviors under normal circumstances.
// Stability test focuses on checking product usages under low-resource, overloaded, recovery, repetitive, high intensity running, long-lasting and iterative operation conditions. This ensures that the operations work as expected without race condition, obvious hang or crash. The maximum amount of data and the failure occurrence rate are collected during the testing.

//==== Usability Test

// Instructions:
// Usability test set defines test cases from an end user perspective, to check the effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction of a product.

//==== Certification Test

// Instructions:
// 

==== Integration Test

// Instructions:
//

The component can access to its system dependencies: gconf, gsettings, printing, networking, 
the help is accessible, the language can be set, ...

The component either integrates itself well to an other one or integrate well an other component into itself.
(for example: the nautilus extensions)

//==== Conformance Test

// Instructions:
//

==== Interopeability Test

// Instructions:
//

Checking that Gnome is interoperable with Mozilla, KDE, ... and more generally any application that isn't GNOME-compliant is out of scope.

=== Test Types

// Instructions:
// Describe how you will use different test types for the component, considering adopting the following test types in test design:
// * Feature Functional Test (positive, negative, internationalization and localization, and so on)
// * GUI Test if the component has GUI, validate if the implementation conforms to UI design.
// * User Experience Test if the component has GUI. Validate if the UI satisfy end users. Refer to related UX checklist defined for the project if any.
// * Stress Test for individual component to guarantee the reliability of component level.
// * Performance Test

==== Functional Positive

Positive testing includes approaches to directly call and test out a command or interface (launch of application, use of menus, buttons, input text fields ...).

==== Functional Negative

Negative testing is to ensure that unexpected or invalid values can be handled gracefully.

It involves counter-testing of a given feature, such as sending in a bad value to an API with the expectation of a failure (Populating required field/input with unsupported/not appropriated values, unsupported format, Oversize data/out of range value, Corrupted data, Wrong settings/configurations (ex: create an invalid Empathy account), Duplication, Launch of application while already launched, Create a contact with an invalid email).

Negative testing is mainly aimed at detecting crashes in different situations.
 
==== Reliability

The purpose of reliability testing is to ensure that the system is able to manage critical situations successfully during a specified period of time without any failure (data loss, latency, crash …). It includes test of Robustness, Recovery, Iterative (stress), Long Lasting (launch and close an application intensively, add one hundred buddies in Chat application, create one hundred contacts in Contact application, populate fields with huge strings ...)

=== Test Methodology

// Instructions:
// If you adopt any specific test methodology to the component or sub-component testing, please give the summary and describe the method in details.
// Following are typical test methods:
//   * White-box Test Methods: Statement Coverage, Branch Coverage, Condition Coverage, Multiple Condition Coverage, Path Coverage, and so on
//   * Black-box Test Methods: Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, Decision Table Testing, State Transition Testing, Use Case Testing, and so on
//   * Experience Based Methods: Error Guessing (weak point testing), Exploratory Testing, and so on

We will adopt specific test methodologies to the component or sub-component testing:

White-box Test Methods::
- execution of command lines from a Terminal that tests internal structures
- communication with d-Bus
- verification of services and daemon

Black-box Test Methods::
- execution of command lines from a Terminal that tests functionality
- manual tests covering functionality of the system using the User Interface, peripherals (keyboard, mouse ...)
