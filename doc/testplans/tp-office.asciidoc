== Scope of this Document 

This test plan defines test scope, test strategy and test execution for {componentName} within Tizen PC.

== Glossary 
--
* ODF : Open Document Format
* SVG : Scalable vector graphics - XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics that has support for interactivity and animation
* LO : LibreOffice
* RTF : Rich Text Format - proprietary document file format with published specifications developed by Microsoft Corporation
* GStreamer : pipeline-based multimedia framework
--
NOTE: Please mailto:{email}[report] anything unclear in acronyms. 

== Component Summary 

LibreOffice v4.0 is a freely available, fully-featured office productivity suite. 

Its native file format is Open Document Format (ODF), an open standard format that is being adopted by governments
worldwide as a required file format for publishing and accepting documents. 

LibreOffice v4.0 can also open and save documents in many other formats, including those used by several versions of
Microsoft Office.

The LibreOffice v4.0 suite includes a word processor, spreadsheet, graphics editor, slideshow creator, database and math formula writer.
{componentName} for Tizen-PC is expected to be composed of :
--
* Writer : A word processor with similar functionnality and file support to Microsoft Word or WordPerfect
* Calc : A spreadsheet program, similar to Microsoft Excel or Lotus 1-2-3. It has a number of unique features, including a system which automatically defines series of graphs, based on information available to the user.
* Impress : A presentation program resembling Microsoft PowerPoint. Presentations can be exported as SWF files, allowing them to be viewed on any computer with Adobe Flash installed.
--

Moreover, all these applications have to be packaged without :
--
* Java
* OpenSSL
--

LibreOffice v4.0 will be part of TizenPC image out of box :
--
* {jira}/TZPC-76
--

That is the reason why Java and OpenSSL dependencies are being removed 
so it can be packaged with no licensing issues and why this test plan was requested to be written.



For the moment, LibreOffice v4.0 is focused on english language only.


For the moment printing is not POR and might be blocked temporarily, but it will be added to the Feature list request after the package list is reviewed by architects :

== Features to be Tested 

// Instructions
// List all of the features of this component.
// Assign a test priority to each feature and provide reasons. 
// This requires some risk analysis. Here Priority considerations are user impact and likelihood of defect.
// 
// Priority table:
//
//             \           Likelyhood
//              \  
//   User Impact \| High | Medium | Low        |
//  -------------------------------------------|
// | High         | P1   | P2     | P2         |
// | Medium       | P2   | P3     | P3         |
// | Low          | P2   | P3     | Not tested |
//  ------------------------------------------- 
//
// Risk analysis examples:
// * P2: Likelihood of defect in this library is low as it is from upstream and stable enough after many releases. Current version 3.2 is also utilized in Fedora. But it is a key package of all user experience(UX) applications. So user impact is High if it has a defect.
// * P1: Likelihood of defect in this library is high as it is a newly developed component from scratch. Moreover, it is a key package of all UX applications. So user impact is also High if it has a defect.

The following table describes features to be tested based on risk analysis:

// Instructions:
// Identify any significant software features or other items that will not be tested.
// If necessary, explain why these items are not to be addressed in this test plan.
// Identify WHY the item is not to be tested. This could include such reasons as:
// * Not to be included in this release of the Software.
// * Low risk: has been used before and is considered stable.
// * Will be released but not tested or documented as a functional part of the release of the software.
// * Third-party features or components that will not be tested by our team.
// * Software features will be tested by other teams.
// * Documentation or legal requirements.

== Test Strategy and Approach 

// Instructions:
// Describe how the component will be tested.
// Specify refinements to the approach described in the project/product test plan.
// Include specific test techniques (such as test methodology, test framework, automation, test type, and test level) to be used.

=== Test Levels

// Instructions:
// Describe the test level (unit test, API level test, integration test, system test, and so on) for different sub-components.
// Test level will reflect the test priority of features.
// Test the high priority items extensively, medium priority items broadly, and the low-priority cursory.
//
// In general, unit test and integration testing are not covered in QA's test plan.
// If certain areas or aspects of the system imply high risks for the product, more thorough testing is obviously a solution.
// Focus testing effort on portions of the software where risk of potential failure is greatest or where potential failure would be most catastrophic.

==== Acceptance Test

// Instructions:
// Acceptance test set is fully automated. It can be run under Common Automated Test System (CATS) or Testkit to check distribution quickly after it's generated by release engineer.
// Acceptance test usually covers image installation, boot up, basic kernel and driver, core services, Power and Performance (PnP) and stability check points, which helps the release engineer to make a quick decision on if the current image is qualified for further integration and QA activities.

Installation of the component using zypper works: the component and its dependencies are installed.

==== Sanity Test

// Instructions:
// Sanity test is a very brief run-through of the entire distribution, to ensure the basic health of the distribution and to report major regressions at the earliest time. All the checkpoints in a doc/TestPlan_template.asciidocsanity test reflect the most important functionality, stability and PnP of the distribution.

The component can be run: none of its runtime dependency is broken, it can start in the Tizen environment without crashing.

==== Main Feature Test

// Instructions:
// Feature test is designed to test product requirements or features. It includes both functional and non-functional (such as performance and stress) tests, as well as negative tests. 
// Feature Test covers both Feature Verification Test (FVT) and Extended Feature Test (EFT).

The main feature(s) of the component works: the component doesnât crash, it performs the expected behaviour in the expected time, it stops itself properly.

//==== Feature Verification Test

// Instructions:
// FVT, the most key test for a feature, is designed to verify product features (in JIRA).
// FVT is conducted on a weekly basis when a feature is implemented and integrated to distribution.
// FVT should be reviewed by developers.
// Feature status update:
//    * A feature is marked Verified/Closed if its FVT passes.
//    * A feature is reopened if its FVT fails. In this case, related major bugs should be linked to the feature.

//==== Extended Feature Test

// Instructions:
// EFT is designed to verify delivery of features forming full functionality of an entire component. 
// After the component is fully integrated, all componen-related test cases will be executed for selected release.
// In addition, all the bugs against the component and its features will be reported. 
// The EFT set will be run again in the upcoming milestone or when significant changes are applied to the component and its features.

//==== DataFlow Test

// Instructions:
// Dataflow is the flow of data to, from and within a device. 
// Inputs are derived from system use cases. Each core dataflow test case presents the basic instance of the use case in core stack.
// The result of core dataflow test could report the maturity level of Core OS software and hardware integration on a specific device.

//==== System Test (E2E Test)

// Instructions:
// System Test is targeting to evaluate delivered functionalities from a system perspective. 
// It tests how the entire system is working and interacting with consumers (end users) instead of user interface (UI) or application.
// Its test cases cover the most critical interaction and negative scenarios that consumers may encounter in their daily usage.
// Therefore, a system test is usually designed to cover product use cases.

//==== PnP Test

// Instructions:
// PnP test set includes all system power and performance test cases, to get memory footprint, CPU consumption, response data, FPS, and smoothness with specific workload.

//==== Stability Test

// Instructions:
// Stability test is designed to determine the robustness of software by testing beyond the limits of normal operation.
// Stability test commonly put greater emphasis on robustness, availability, and error handling under a heavy load, than on what would be considered correct behaviors under normal circumstances.
// Stability test focuses on checking product usages under low-resource, overloaded, recovery, repetitive, high intensity running, long-lasting and iterative operation conditions. This ensures that the operations work as expected without race condition, obvious hang or crash. The maximum amount of data and the failure occurrence rate are collected during the testing.

//==== Usability Test

// Instructions:
// Usability test set defines test cases from an end user perspective, to check the effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction of a product.

//==== Certification Test

// Instructions:
// 

==== Integration Test

// Instructions:

The components are well integrated into Tizen Desktop (present in Applications of Gnome-Shell, can interact with browser, can display full screen, can print etc.)

//==== Conformance Test

// Instructions:
//

==== Interopeability Test

// Instructions:

Document formats interoperability, essentially from Microsoft Office to/from LibreOffice.

=== Test Types

// Instructions:
// Describe how you will use different test types for the component, considering adopting the following test types in test design:
// * Feature Functional Test (positive, negative, internationalization and localization, and so on)
// * GUI Test if the component has GUI, validate if the implementation conforms to UI design.
// * User Experience Test if the component has GUI. Validate if the UI satisfy end users. Refer to related UX checklist defined for the project if any.doc/TestPlan_template.asciidoc
// * Stress Test for individual component to guarantee the reliability of component level.
// * Performance Test

==== Functional Positive

Positive testing includes approaches to directly call and test out a command or interface (launch of application, use of menus, buttons, input text fields â¦).

==== Functional Negative

Negative testing is to ensure that unexpected or invalid values can be handled gracefully.

It involves counter-testing of a given feature, such as sending in a bad value to an API with the expectation of a failure (Populating required field/input with unsupported/not appropriated values, unsupported format, Oversize data/out of range value, Corrupted data, Wrong settings/configurations (ex: create an invalid Empathy account), Duplication, Launch of application while already launched, Create a contact with an invalid email).

Negative testing is mainly aimed at detecting crashes in different situations.

=== Test Methodology

// Instructions:
// If you adopt any specific test methodology to the component or sub-component testing, please give the summary and describe the method in details.
// Following are typical test methods:
//   * White-box Test Methods: Statement Coverage, Branch Coverage, Condition Coverage, Multiple Condition Coverage, Path Coverage, and so on
//   * Black-box Test Methods: Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, Decision Table Testing, State Transition Testing, Use Case Testing, and so on
//   * Experience Based Methods: Error Guessing (weak point testing), Exploratory Testing, and so on

Most of the tests will be done using black-box test methods:
--
* execution of command lines from a Terminal that tests functionality if possible
* manual tests covering functionality of the system using the User Interface, peripherals (keyboard, mouse â¦) 
--

=== Flexibility

// Instructions:

NOTE: This chapter will be detailed after first tests [red]#TODO#

This section can be completed when test execution will start.
Adjust your strategy if it produces an amount of necessary test effort or a time schedule that does not fit testing goals or project constraints.


=== Test Automation 

// Instructions:
// Describe test automation approach. The following contents are suggested
//   * Which part of tests will be automated
//   * Automation goal and automation percentage
//   * Follow the overall test automation strategy in project overall test plan
//   * The whole automated test suite low-level design which is used for guiding implementation. Create a dedicated document for it if required.
//   * Test framework and test automation tools to be used
//   * Test automation environment, including hardware, peripherals, software configuration, and so on
//   * Programming language

For LibreOffice or other applications (evince, ...), some operations can be executed in command line, thus minimizing the need for actions on the GUI menus, buttons etc. But the automation is limited because the effects must be verified visually.

NOTE: This chapter should be detailed after first tests [red]#TODO#

== Test Design 

// Instructions:
// Adopt the test approach above to the component, define test points or design detailed test cases.
// Follow the common test design method if the project has defined it.
// Specify the test case organization and naming convention for this component.
// Specify the necessary test data used by test cases
// Specify the possible test set of the test cases. The test set can be determined by test case priority, test cycle, test purpose and so on. We have typical test sets as below:
// * Feature Test (FT)
// * Extended Feature Test (EFT)
// * Feature Verification Test (FVT): test cases used to verify feature integration.
// * Regression Test (RT) - test cases used for regression test.
//
// Typical test design should include the following aspects:
// * ID of the requirement to be tested
// * [Optional] Features extended by this requirement to be tested
// * Multiple test points derived from the requirement/feature to be tested
// * A test case or a set of test cases (following the naming convention) for the test point
// * Test case priority
// * Test set which test cases will serve
