CONNMAN:: ConnMan is a Connection Manager that provides a daemon for managing internet connections within embedded devices running the Linux operating system. In Tizen PC ConnMan is the main component that handles network connections. Decision has been taken to completely remove the classical gnome component : NetworkManager  

DBUS:: D-BUS is an Inter Process Communication (IPC) system, widely used by open source desktop software. It's a framework that allows : 
* running applications to share messages between themselves
* desktop to communicate with its applications 
* desktop to communicate with the operating system 
  :: Since ConnMan is a D-BUS based application, all applications should use D-BUS to communicate with the Connection Manager (ConnMan)

DHCP:: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. This is a protocol for dynamic assignment of IP addresses on a network  
DNS:: Domain System Name. This is a protocol that allow to assign a domain name to an IP address 
PROXY:: A server located between a local network and the internet 
TETHERING:: The process of using a device as a modem to share a internet connection 
VPN:: Virtual Private Network. A network that use internet to provide remote offices of individual users with secure access to their organization's network

== Component Summary 

// Instructions:
// Expect a short paragraph to describe the component and add link for further information about this component.
// Also put major hyperlinks to projects responsible for the component

=== ConnMan

In Tizen PC all network connections are managed with ConnMan. 
ConnMan is designed to be slim and use as few ressources as possible, so it can be easily integrated. 
Originally used for embedded systems, ConnMan is now also used in desktop environment. 
ConnMan is designed with a modular architecture to easily add/remove a service or a component. 
The ConnMan architecure consists of the following parts :

--
[horizontal]
CONNMAND::
    connmand is the core component of ConnMan that handle all connections
CONNMANCTL::
	 Connmanctl is a Connman command line interface which can be run in two modes :
	 * a plain synchronous command input 
	 * an asynchronous interactive shell
 :: Connmantl can handle most simple network connections. It is able to enable/disable any technology that exists on the system, display a list of services available, connect to/disconnect from any (un)secured networks, show properties of the system, the technologies, and any individual service, and configure all of the properties. It is also able to monitor changes in the properties of the services, technologies, and the system
CONNMAN UI::
	 This is a GUI that enable to interact with connmand. Basic and extended funtionalities like enable/disable a network technology or set up a domain name, are offered by a ConnMan UI. A ConnMan UI communicates with the core daemon using the D-Bus system message bus. Several UI can be running at the same time on the system. Tizen PC is provided with two ConnMan UIs :
	 * _gnome-exension-connman_ is a gnome extension that handles basic setups of network features. Functionalities are available from the top menu bar of gnome shell, in the gnome status area. Like most of gnome extensions, _gnome-exension-connman_ is written in JavaScript
	 * _Network_ panel of gnome-control-center which provides the ability to handle basic and enhanced settings of network connections. _Network_ panel of gnome-control-center is written in C and uses the GTK3 library
PLUGINS::
	 Since ConnMan has a modular architecture, each network service is handled by a plugin. Plugins allow connectivity with connmand at low level. In Tizen PC, the following technologies are ensured by ConnMan :
	 * Ethernet
	 * Wifi
	 * Bluetooth
	 * 3G
	 * VPN
 :: Plugins are developed based on other open source components such as wpa_supplicant for the Wifi, bluez for the Bluetooth.

The following picture shows the different components of ConnMan in Tizen PC :

=== Bluetooth applet and Bluetooth panel

In Tizen PC, ConnMan UIs only allows to enable/disable the bluetooth device and scan for the bluetooth services. Bluetooth features are accessible by two front-end user interfaces :

--
[horizontal]
Bluetooth applet:: 
	enable/disable the bluetooth device - enable/disable visibility - add/remove a device - send files - open the Bluetooth panel
Blutooth panel:: 
	enable/disable the bluetooth device - enable/disable visibility - add/remove a device - send files 
--

Both of those user interfaces comes from the GNOME project and allow to handle all the bluetooth features. They call other user interfaces also provided by the GNOME project : 

* bluetooth-wizard : allows to scan and pair a device
* bluetooth-sendto : allows to send files to other devices

== Features to be Tested 

// Instructions
// List all of the features of this component.
// Assign a test priority to each feature and provide reasons. 
// This requires some risk analysis. Here Priority considerations are user impact and likelihood of defect.
// 
// Priority table:
//
//             \           Likelyhood
//              \  
//   User Impact \| High | Medium | Low        |
//  -------------------------------------------|
// | High         | P1   | P2     | P2         |
// | Medium       | P2   | P3     | P3         |
// | Low          | P2   | P3     | Not tested |
//  ------------------------------------------- 
//
// Risk analysis examples:
// * P2: Likelihood of defect in this library is low as it is from upstream and stable enough after many releases. Current version 3.2 is also utilized in Fedora. But it is a key package of all user experience(UX) applications. So user impact is High if it has a defect.
// * P1: Likelihood of defect in this library is high as it is a newly developed component from scratch. Moreover, it is a key package of all UX applications. So user impact is also High if it has a defect.

Test will focus on network connectivity through user interfaces. The goal is to ensure the quality of the integration of ConnMan UIs, Bluetooth UIs and their interaction in Tizen PC. 
//This test plan covers functional and integration tests through the user interfaces. 
Ability to join any network connection which use a given technology will be checked through the user interfaces. 
This test plan also covers connectivity of several Bluetooth peripherals. +

// Describe the test level (unit test, API level test, integration test, system test, and so on) for different sub-components.
// Test level will reflect the test priority of features.
// Test the high priority items extensively, medium priority items broadly, and the low-priority cursory.
//
// In general, unit test and integration testing are not covered in QA's test plan.
// If certain areas or aspects of the system imply high risks for the product, more thorough testing is obviously a solution.
// Focus testing effort on portions of the software where risk of potential failure is greatest or where potential failure would be most catastrophic.

==== Acceptance Test

// Instructions:
// Acceptance test set is fully automated. It can be run under Common Automated Test System (CATS) or Testkit to check distribution quickly after it's generated by release engineer.
// Acceptance test usually covers image installation, boot up, basic kernel and driver, core services, Power and Performance (PnP) and stability check points, which helps the release engineer to make a quick decision on if the current image is qualified for further integration and QA activities.

All the icons of the user interfaces are available : 

* gnome-extension-connman (available in the system status area of gnome top menu bar)
* Bluetooth applet (available in the system status area of gnome top menu bar)
* ConnMan UI (available under gnome-control-center menu, as the 'Network' panel
* Bluetooth panel (available under gnome-control-center menu, as the 'Bluetooth' panel)

Layout of all user interfaces meet its requirements in accordance with the specification

==== Sanity Test

// Instructions:
// Sanity test is a very brief run-through of the entire distribution, to ensure the basic health of the distribution and to report major regressions at the earliest time. All the checkpoints in a sanity test reflect the most important functionality, stability and PnP of the distribution.

All the user inerfaces can be launched.

==== Features Test

// Instructions:
// Feature test is designed to test product requirements or features. It includes both functional and non-functional (such as performance and stress) tests, as well as negative tests. 
// Feature Test covers both Feature Verification Test (FVT) and Extended Feature Test (EFT).

Main features works under all the user interfaces. We will check that a given technology :
* can be enabled/disabled 
* is usable : user manages to join a network 

//==== Feature Verification Test

// Instructions:
// FVT, the most key test for a feature, is designed to verify product features (in JIRA).
// FVT is conducted on a weekly basis when a feature is implemented and integrated to distribution.
// FVT should be reviewed by developers.
// Feature status update:
//    * A feature is marked Verified/Closed if its FVT passes.
//    * A feature is reopened if its FVT fails. In this case, related major bugs should be linked to the feature.

//==== Extended Feature Test

// Instructions:
// EFT is designed to verify delivery of features forming full functionality of an entire component. 
// After the component is fully integrated, all componen-related test cases will be executed for selected release.
// In addition, all the bugs against the component and its features will be reported. 
// The EFT set will be run again in the upcoming milestone or when significant changes are applied to the component and its features.

//==== DataFlow Test

// Instructions:
// Dataflow is the flow of data to, from and within a device. 
// Inputs are derived from system use cases. Each core dataflow test case presents the basic instance of the use case in core stack.
// The result of core dataflow test could report the maturity level of Core OS software and hardware integration on a specific device.

//==== System Test (E2E Test)

// Instructions:
// System Test is targeting to evaluate delivered functionalities from a system perspective. 
// It tests how the entire system is working and interacting with consumers (end users) instead of user interface (UI) or application.
// Its test cases cover the most critical interaction and negative scenarios that consumers may encounter in their daily usage.
// Therefore, a system test is usually designed to cover product use cases.

==== PnP Test

// Instructions:
// PnP test set includes all system power and performance test cases, to get memory footprint, CPU consumption, response data, FPS, and smoothness with specific workload. 

Power consumption when a given technology is activated is acceptable compared to a reference target.

==== Stability Test

// Instructions:
// Stability test is designed to determine the robustness of software by testing beyond the limits of normal operation.
// Stability test commonly put greater emphasis on robustness, availability, and error handling under a heavy load, than on what would be considered correct behaviors under normal circumstances.
// Stability test focuses on checking product usages under low-resource, overloaded, recovery, repetitive, high intensity running, long-lasting and iterative operation conditions. This ensures that the operations work as expected without race condition, obvious hang or crash. The maximum amount of data and the failure occurrence rate are collected during the testing.

We will test if a network connection under a give technology is  stable  
//====Usability Test

// Instructions:
// Usability test set defines test cases from an end user perspective, to check the effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction of a product.

//==== Certification Test

// Instructions:
// 

==== Integration Test

gnome-extension-connman, Bluetooth applet, ConnMan UI, Bluetooth panel user interfaces are well integrated in Tizen. 
We will check that there is a consistent behavior when actions are performed with theses different user interfaces.

//==== Conformance Test

// Instructions:
//

==== Interopeirability Test

Network features are available from all the user interfaces.

=== Test Types

// Instructions:
// Describe how you will use different test types for the component, considering adopting the following test types in test design:
// * Feature Functional Test (positive, negative, internationalization and localization, and so on)
// * GUI Test if the component has GUI, validate if the implementation conforms to UI design.
// * User Experience Test if the component has GUI. Validate if the UI satisfy end users. Refer to related UX checklist defined for the project if any.
// * Stress Test for individual component to guarantee the reliability of component level.
// * Performance Test

==== Functional Positive

Positive testing includes approaches to directly call and test out a command or interface (launch of application, use of menus, buttons, input text fields ...).

==== Functional Negative

Negative testing is to ensure that unexpected or invalid values can be handled gracefully.

It involves counter-testing of a given feature, such as sending in a bad value to an API with the expectation of a failure (Populating required field/input with unsupported/not appropriated values, unsupported format, Oversize data/out of range value, Corrupted data, Wrong settings/configurations ...

Negative testing is mainly aimed at detecting crashes in different situations.
 
==== Reliability

The purpose of reliability testing is to ensure that the system is able to manage critical situations successfully during a specified period of time without any failure (data loss, latency, crash …). It includes test of Robustness, Recovery, Iterative (stress), Long Lasting (launch and close an application intensively, add one hundred buddies in Chat application, create one hundred contacts in Contact application, populate fields with huge strings ...)


=== Test Methodology

// Instructions:
// If you adopt any specific test methodology to the component or sub-component testing, please give the summary and describe the method in details.

//   * Black-box Test Methods: Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, Decision Table Testing, State Transition Testing, Use Case Testing, and so on
//   * Experience Based Methods: Error Guessing (weak point testing), Exploratory Testing, and so on

Most of the tests are manual and are performed through the user interfaces.
