The test case definition is compatible with the one used in Enterprise Tester:

--
[horizontal]
Priority:: ranges from 0 (most important) to 4 (less important) - for compliance with features priorities, we consider that P0=P1 and P3=P4. This could be used though for specific filtering and ordering in Enterprise Tester.
Status:: designed => ready => approved
Type:: functional_positive | functional_negative | security | performance | reliability | portability | maintainability | user_experience | compliance
Execution type:: manual or auto
Notes and bugs:: added to refer to Jira issues (these fields don't exist in Enterprise Tester, but can be added to objective and description) - should be displayed in QA Reports
Objective:: test case title
Description:: detailed description
Pre-condition:: which condition must be fullfilled before executing the steps
Steps:: describes the steps to be executed and awaited result for each one. A test case passes the test if ALL expected results have been observed.
Post-condition:: some operations to execute after the steps (to restore an initial state, for example)
--

IMPORTANT: An automated test doesn't need pre/post conditions or steps. This is the executed script that handles these aspects.
