Network infrastructure should support at least the following services to ensure proper coverage:
--
* wired LAN (Ethernet)
* wireless LAN (Wifi) with multiple security levels (Open, WEP, WPA, WPA2 ..;)
--

Some extra interfaces could also be used for extended functionnalities coming in the near future:
--
* BlueTooth
* 3G Network (HSDPA, HSDPA+, UMTS ...)
--
