== Features to be Tested 

// Instructions
// List all of the features of this component.
// Assign a test priority to each feature and provide reasons. 
// This requires some risk analysis. Here Priority considerations are user impact and 

// 
// Priority table:
//
//             \           Likelyhood
//              \  
//   User Impact \| High | Medium | Low        |
//  -------------------------------------------|
// | High         | P1   | P2     | P2         |
// | Medium       | P2   | P3     | P3         |
// | Low          | P2   | P3     | Not tested |
//  ------------------------------------------- 
//
// Risk analysis examples:
// * P2: Likelihood of defect in this library is low as it is from upstream and stable enough after many releases. Current version 3.2 is also utilized in Fedora. But it is a key package of all user experience(UX) applications. So user impact is High if it has a defect.
// * P1: Likelihood of defect in this library is high as it is a newly developed component from scratch. Moreover, it is a key package of all UX applications. So user impact is also High if it has a defect.

Tests will focus on {componentName} integration in Tizen PC.

For each feature listed below, an associated test set is defined.

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| core | Google Chrome core functionality (ex: HTML5 conformance, performances, etc.)| This is tested upstream
|===================================================================================================================

== Test Strategy and Approach 

// Instructions:
// Describe how the component will be tested.
// Specify refinements to the approach described in the project/product test plan.
// Include specific test techniques (such as test methodology, test framework, automation, test type, and test level) to be used.

Google Chrome core features aren't to be tested in this test plan.

The aim of this test plan is to ensure the best user experience of a Google Chrome user in Tizen PC desktop environment.

Google Chrome test plan focuses on the following features that interact with Tizen PC :
--
* web browsing experience
* web applications experience
* configure Google Chrome
--

=== Test Levels

// Instructions:
// Describe the test level (unit test, API level test, integration test, system test, and so on) for different sub-components.
// Test level will reflect the test priority of features.
// Test the high priority items extensively, medium priority items broadly, and the low-priority cursory.
//
// In general, unit test and integration testing are not covered in QA's test plan.
// If certain areas or aspects of the system imply high risks for the product, more thorough testing is obviously a solution.
// Focus testing effort on portions of the software where risk of potential failure is greatest or where potential failure would be most catastrophic.

Several test levels will be needed. It will reflect the test priority of features.

We will test the high priority items extensively, medium priority items broadly, and the low-priority cursory.

Unit test are not covered in this test plan, as already executed on upstream product.

We will focus testing effort on portions of the software where risk of potential failure is greatest or where potential failure would be most catastrophic.

//==== Acceptance Test

// Instructions:
// Acceptance test set is fully automated. It can be run under Common Automated Test System (CATS) or Testkit to check distribution quickly after it's generated by release engineer.
// Acceptance test usually covers image installation, boot up, basic kernel and driver, core services, Power and Performance (PnP) and stability check points, which helps the release engineer to make a quick decision on if the current image is qualified for further integration and QA activities.

==== Sanity Test

// Instructions:
// Sanity test is a very brief run-through of the entire distribution, to ensure the basic health of the distribution and to report major regressions at the earliest time. All the checkpoints in a doc/TestPlan_template.asciidocsanity test reflect the most important functionality, stability and PnP of the distribution.

We will briefly test the key functionalities of {componentName} to assure that it works roughly as expected. This is often prior to a more exhaustive round of testing.

==== Feature Test

// Instructions:
// Feature test is designed to test product requirements or features. It includes both functional and non-functional (such as performance and stress) tests, as well as negative tests. 
// Feature Test covers both Feature Verification Test (FVT) and Extended Feature Test (EFT).

Google Chrome features works: Google Chrome doesn't crash, it 
performs the expected behaviour in the expected time, it stops itself properly.


//==== Feature Verification Test

// Instructions:
// FVT, the most key test for a feature, is designed to verify product features (in JIRA).
// FVT is conducted on a weekly basis when a feature is implemented and integrated to distribution.
// FVT should be reviewed by developers.
// Feature status update:
//    * A feature is marked Verified/Closed if its FVT passes.
//    * A feature is reopened if its FVT fails. In this case, related major bugs should be linked to the feature.

//==== Extended Feature Test

// Instructions:
// EFT is designed to verify delivery of features forming full functionality of an entire component. 
// After the component is fully integrated, all componen-related test cases will be executed for selected release.
// In addition, all the bugs against the component and its features will be reported. 
// The EFT set will be run again in the upcoming milestone or when significant changes are applied to the component and its features.

//==== DataFlow Test

// Instructions:
// Dataflow is the flow of data to, from and within a device. 
// Inputs are derived from system use cases. Each core dataflow test case presents the basic instance of the use case in core stack.
// The result of core dataflow test could report the maturity level of Core OS software and hardware integration on a specific device.

//==== System Test (E2E Test)

// Instructions:
// System Test is targeting to evaluate delivered functionalities from a system perspective. 
// It tests how the entire system is working and interacting with consumers (end users) instead of user interface (UI) or application.
// Its test cases cover the most critical interaction and negative scenarios that consumers may encounter in their daily usage.
// Therefore, a system test is usually designed to cover product use cases.

//==== PnP Test

// Instructions:
// PnP test set includes all system power and performance test cases, to get memory footprint, CPU consumption, response data, FPS, and smoothness with specific workload.

//==== Stability Test

// Instructions:
// Stability test is designed to determine the robustness of software by testing beyond the limits of normal operation.
// Stability test commonly put greater emphasis on robustness, availability, and error handling under a heavy load, than on what would be considered correct behaviors under normal circumstances.
// Stability test focuses on checking product usages under low-resource, overloaded, recovery, repetitive, high intensity running, long-lasting and iterative operation conditions. This ensures that the operations work as expected without race condition, obvious hang or crash. The maximum amount of data and the failure occurrence rate are collected during the testing.

//==== Usability Test

// Instructions:
// Usability test set defines test cases from an end user perspective, to check the effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction of a product.

//==== Certification Test

// Instructions:
// 

==== Integration Test

// Instructions:
//

Usually, integration tests are performed to ensure that multiple software blocks can work together globally, given that each block was previously validated by unit tests. The goal is to validate a correct interaction between all components, here, Google Chrome ingration in Tizen PC environment (Gnome Shell, Tizen Shell mostly).  

//==== Conformance Test

// Instructions:
//

//==== Interopeability Test

// Instructions:
//

=== Test Types

// Instructions:
// Describe how you will use different test types for the component, considering adopting the following test types in test design:
// * Feature Functional Test (positive, negative, internationalization and localization, and so on)
// * GUI Test if the component has GUI, validate if the implementation conforms to UI design.
// * User Experience Test if the component has GUI. Validate if the UI satisfy end users. Refer to related UX checklist defined for the project if any.doc/TestPlan_template.asciidoc
// * Stress Test for individual component to guarantee the reliability of component level.
// * Performance Test

The following test types will be used:
--
* Functional positive and negative
* User experience
--


=== Test Methodology

// Instructions:
// If you adopt any specific test methodology to the component or sub-component testing, please give the summary and describe the method in details.
// Following are typical test methods:
//   * White-box Test Methods: Statement Coverage, Branch Coverage, Condition Coverage, Multiple Condition Coverage, Path Coverage, and so on
//   * Black-box Test Methods: Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, Decision Table Testing, State Transition Testing, Use Case Testing, and so on
//   * Experience Based Methods: Error Guessing (weak point testing), Exploratory Testing, and so on

Most of the tests are manual and are performed through the user interface.

All the tests are black-box testing.
