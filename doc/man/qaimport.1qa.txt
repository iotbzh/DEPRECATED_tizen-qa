== NAME

qaimport - import test cases from a CSV file

== SYNOPSIS

qaimport [options]

== DESCRIPTION

*qaimport* creates test cases in the QA database from a CSV file (a comma
separated value). It creates the test cases in one or more QAMETA files.

The existing QAMETA files are NEVER overwritten. You must (re)move it before
if the importation have to be done.

== OPTIONS

*-c, --config*='DIRECTORY'::
    Set the path to the configuration directory to 'DIRECTORY'.
    It defaults to SCRIPTDIR/../etc where SCRIPTDIR is the directory
    of *qaimport*.

*-d, --db*='DIRECTORY'::
    Set the path to the database directory to 'DIRECTORY'.
    It defaults to SCRIPTDIR/../db where SCRIPTDIR is the directory
    of *qaimport*.

*-h, --help*::
    Prints a short help and exits.

*-i, --input*='FILE'::
    Tell *qaimport* to use the input file 'FILE' instead of the standard
    input (note, writing -i - is synonim of using the standard input).

*-n, --dryrun*::
    Dry-run, *qaimport* runs on the input but doesn't produce test cases in
    the dabatbase.

== FORMATS

The CSV file must be UTF-8 encoded. 

The first record MUST be the field names, the remaining records being the
values. The field names MUST be standard field names of the QAMETA files 
(see QAMETA(5qa)) except for the field naemd *path* that is specific.
Not all standard field names are needed in the CSV file.

The remaining records encode the test cases.

The MANDATORY field of name *path* is used to give the name of the QAMETA file 
for the defined test case in the QA database filesystem.
