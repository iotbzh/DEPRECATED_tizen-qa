= QAMANAGER(1qa)

== NAME

qamanager - execute a test suite from the QA database using TestKit and CATS 
and submit the report.

== SYNOPSIS

qamanager host profile [options]

== DESCRIPTION

*qamanager* generate the test data for TestKit/CATS from the QA database,
then it submits the test to TestKit/CATS that report the result.

The test is on *host* and with the test suite defined by *profile(s)*.

The *host* is the name of the target. *qamanager* accesses this target with
*ssh* to get its build-id.

The test data are generated for some test cases/test suites as defined by the
argument *profile*. The argument *profile* is a KEY to a profile defined
in *etc/profile*. It can also be a list of KEYS separated with blanks (use
quotes). The special key ALL is expanded to "sanity packaging"

The predefined profiles of *etc/test_suites.conf* available for TestKit export
are: *packaging*, *sanity*, *manual*, *gnome*, *mm*, *qadevel*.

To submit the report, you MUST use the option *--report* with a value
not equal to *default*.

== OPTIONS

#*-b, --buildid*='BUILID'::
#    The image identification, aka th build-ID.

*-c, --config*='DIRECTORY'::

    It defaults to SCRIPTDIR/../etc where SCRIPTDIR is the directory
    of *qaexport*.

*-d, --db*='DIRECTORY'::
    Set the path to the database directory to 'DIRECTORY'.
    It defaults to SCRIPTDIR/../db where SCRIPTDIR is the directory
    of *qaexport*.

*-h, --help*::
    Prints a short help and exits.

*-i, --image*='URL'::
    The image 'URL' (the default value is deduced from build-ID read from the 
    target host).

*-n, --dryrun*::
    Dry-run, *qamanager* runs and generates the test data but doesn't submit
    the test to TestKit/CATS.

*-r, --report*='KEY'::

    file *etc/test_reports.conf*.
    The default report type KEY is *default*.

    The predefined report types are: *default* (no report),

    (for the trunk releases), *qareport_devel* (for the devel releases).

#*-p, --profile*='KEY'::
#    Selects the export profile of name 'KEY' in the profiles configuration
#    file *etc/test_suites.conf*.

#*-t, --target*='TARGET'::
#    The target hostname as declared in etc/targets.conf.

=== Generated test data

The test data are generated in the directory
*/tmp/libqa/BUILDID_PROFILE_TARGET_TIMESTAMP*.
Where *BUILDID* is the build-ID of tizen tested,
*PROFILE* is the profile key,
*TARGET* is the target key,
*TIMESTAMP* is *YYYYMMMDD_HHMMSSU*.

The files in that directory are: 
the CATS recipe in *cats.recipe*, the TestKit data in *testkit.xml* and
the material for test in *tests.tar.gz*.

== EXAMPLE

This example generate the files for passing sanity tests

 qamanager lenovo01 sanity -n

This example runs the multimedia tests

 qamanager lenovo01 mm
